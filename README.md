Mash for Live (Music Hack Day Berlin 2014)
============================================

There is an abundance of free music available online that just begs to be remixed and mashed up. However, the process of downloading tracks, slicing them into usable pieces and laying them out in Ableton Live is tedious and time consuming. Why not let a computer do the boring part so us humans can concentrate on being creative?

The goal of this project is to create an online tool for finding freely downloadable tracks from SoundCloud and compiling them into an Ableton Live set with pre-sliced clips. The slicing will be based on the analysis results retrieved from the Echo Nest API.
